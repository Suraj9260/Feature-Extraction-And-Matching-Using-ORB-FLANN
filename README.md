# Feature Extraction And Matching Using ORB and FLANN

This project demonstrates feature extraction and matching using the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature detector and FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) based matcher in OpenCV.

## :star2: Overview

This project leverages the power of computer vision to identify and match keypoints between images in real-time. The ORB feature detector and descriptor is used for efficient and effective feature detection and description. FLANN-based matching is implemented for robust and fast matching of features.




### Key Features

- Utilizes ORB for efficient and effective feature detection and description.
- Implements FLANN for robust and fast matching of features.
- Handles real-time video input from a webcam to match features between a static input image and live frames.
- Demonstrates potential applications in object recognition, tracking, and augmented reality.

### :gear: Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FurkanKhann/Feature-Extraction-And-Matching-Using-ORB-FLANN.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd Feature-Extraction-And-Matching-Using-ORB-FLANN
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   import cv2
   import numpy as np

### :triangular_flag_on_post: Usage

1. Place your input image (t1.jpg) in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   
   ```bash
   Feature1.py
3. The script will access your webcam and start the feature extraction and matching process in real-time. Press 'ESC' to exit.
